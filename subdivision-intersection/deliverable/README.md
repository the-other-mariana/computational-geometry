# Subdivision Intersection

## Usage

1. In the input folder, there are folders named 01, 02. Those are the two examples: 	
	
	- input/01 contains the three files (.ari, .ver, .car) for the lines crossing example.
	
	- input/02 contains the three files (.ari, .ver, .car) for the triangles crossing example.

2. In the output folder, inside the files folder is where the program writes the layer03 files (.ari, .ver, .car) that result from the input layers.

3. To run, please type: 

```
$ python main.py
```

4. Go to: `output > files` and you will find the resulting files (.ari, .ver, .car) that the program writes. Inside output folder, there are also the plot images of the result.

5. To change the example folder that the program uses, go to main.py, and on the line 16, write the folder name (01 or 02) of the example you want to run.
