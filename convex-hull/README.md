# Convex Hull

Now, using the `glibrary.py` functions, the code `convex-hull.py` solves the problem of calculating a convex hull of a series of 2D points. <br />

## Problem Set 02

### Problem 1

Given a set of points (x,y), each on N different lines, plot their convex hull. <br />

Given points: <br />

Their convex hull: <br />

#### Test Case 3: [test file](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/computational-geometry/blob/master/convex-hull/convex-hull-algorithm/3.in)

### Problem 2

Given a set of points (x,y), each on N different lines, plot their convex hull animation, showing how the points are removed and the convex hull gets constructed. <br />

### Problem 3

Given a set of points of a polygon (not necesarily convex), calculate the smallest 'hole' length in which the polygon can pass through the hole. The polygon can be 'rotated' one time only. Provide the answer as a rounded number with two decimal points.

#### Test Case 1: [test file](https://github.com/the-other-mariana/computational-geometry/blob/master/convex-hull/problem3/1.in)

#### Output: 525.55
