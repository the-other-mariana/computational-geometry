# Convex Hull

Now, using the `glibrary.py` functions, the code `convex-hull.py` plots a convex hull given a set of N points, each on a different line. <br />

## Problem Set 02

### Problem 1

Given a set of points (x,y), each on N different lines, plot their convex hull. <br />

Given points: <br />

### Problem 2

Given a set of points (x,y), each on N different lines, plot their convex hull animation, showing how the points are removed and the convex hull gets constructed. <br />
